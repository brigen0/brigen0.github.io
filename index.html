    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: RoBall</h3>
    <p>
	This is my first project for Bootcamp 2020. This project includes different elements. In the UI side we've got elements such as rectangles, balls, background image, background sound etc. 
  The recangles function as obstructions where every time the ball hits them the ball goes back to its start point. There's also another obstruction which is another ball, bigger then the active one, and it has the same function as the ractangles. 
  All this is done using the other side of elements which is the coding side of it. I used LOOPS in order to create a countinues movement of objects and I also used 'IF' statements to make sure that these movements are the right ones for the game to play smoothly. There's also other elements used such as CLASSES, METHODS, GROUPS etc., which I tried to combine as good as I could and create the outcome of the game.
